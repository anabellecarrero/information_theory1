Compression Assigments and Library for the Introduction to Theory Course took at the Federal University of Para√≠ba.

Project description:

This project was divided into two sections:
Firstly, a compressor/decompressor implementation utilizing the LZW algorithm (which was seen in class) with an arithmetic coding. Taking under advisement that the messages were generated by sources that have alphabet A = {0, 1,...,255}, the compressor/decompressor were tested with a binary video file (disco.mp4) and a 16-MB Portuguese corpus text (corpus16MB.txt).

As we chose the LZW algorithm, there were screening tests with different maximum dictionary sizes. The maximum discretionary size must be 2*(K), where should range between 9 and 16. K indicates the number of bits in which each dictionary index must be stored. 

Example: K = 9 bits, dictionary size: 2*(9) = 512

Notes:
The test file symbols should be read in binary mode (numbers), not text mode (strings or characters).
It must be a numeric symbol dictionary, not a character one.
The coder must have a file as input and generate a coded file as output. Furthermore, the decoder must have a coded file as an input and generate a decoded file as an output, exactly like the original one.
